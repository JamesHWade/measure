\title{Fourier Low-Pass Filtering}
\usage{
step_measure_filter_fourier(
  recipe,
  measures = NULL,
  cutoff = 0.1,
  type = c("lowpass", "highpass"),
  role = NA,
  trained = FALSE,
  skip = FALSE,
  id = recipes::rand_id("measure_filter_fourier")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object.}

\item{measures}{An optional character vector of measure column names.}

\item{cutoff}{The cutoff frequency as a fraction of the Nyquist frequency
(0 to 0.5). Default is 0.1. Frequencies above this are attenuated.
Tunable via \code{\link[=fourier_cutoff]{fourier_cutoff()}}.}

\item{type}{Type of filter: \code{"lowpass"} (default) keeps low frequencies,
\code{"highpass"} keeps high frequencies.}

\item{role}{Not used.}

\item{trained}{Logical indicating if the step has been trained.}

\item{skip}{Logical. Should the step be skipped when baking?}

\item{id}{Unique step identifier.}
}
\value{
An updated recipe with the new step added.
}
\description{
\code{step_measure_filter_fourier()} creates a \emph{specification} of a recipe step
that applies Fourier-domain low-pass filtering to remove high-frequency
noise.
}
\details{
Fourier filtering transforms the spectrum to the frequency domain using FFT,
applies a frequency mask, and transforms back. This is effective for:
\itemize{
\item Removing periodic noise
\item Smoothing with precise frequency control
\item Removing high-frequency detector noise
}

The cutoff is specified as a fraction of the Nyquist frequency. A cutoff
of 0.1 keeps only the lowest 10\% of frequencies.
