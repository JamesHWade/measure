\title{Project n-dimensional measurement by aggregating across dimensions}
\usage{
measure_project(x, along, fn = mean, na_rm = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{measure_nd_tbl} or \code{measure_nd_list} object.}

\item{along}{Integer or character specifying which dimension(s) to
aggregate across. Can use dimension numbers or names.}

\item{fn}{Aggregation function. Default is \code{mean}.}

\item{na_rm}{Logical. Remove NA values before aggregation? Default \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{fn}.}
}
\value{
A \code{measure_tbl}, \code{measure_nd_tbl}, \code{measure_list}, or
\code{measure_nd_list} with reduced dimensionality.
}
\description{
Reduces dimensionality by applying an aggregation function across
one or more dimensions.

\examples{
# Create 2D measurement (time x wavelength)
m2d <- new_measure_nd_tbl(
  location_1 = rep(1:5, each = 3),
  location_2 = rep(c(254, 280, 320), times = 5),
  value = rnorm(15, mean = 100),
  dim_names = c("time", "wavelength")
)

# Project across wavelength (average spectrum at each time)
time_trace <- measure_project(m2d, along = 2)

# Project across time (average time profile at each wavelength)
wavelength_profile <- measure_project(m2d, along = 1)

# Use sum instead of mean
total <- measure_project(m2d, along = 2, fn = sum)
