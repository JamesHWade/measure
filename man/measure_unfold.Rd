\title{Unfold n-dimensional measurement to 1D}
\usage{
measure_unfold(x, order = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{measure_nd_tbl} or \code{measure_nd_list} object.}

\item{order}{Integer vector specifying the order of dimensions for
unfolding. Default is \code{NULL}, which uses the natural order (1, 2, ..., n).
The first dimension varies fastest.}
}
\value{
A \code{measure_tbl} or \code{measure_list} with an attribute \code{"fold_info"}
containing the metadata needed to reconstruct the nD structure.
}
\description{
Converts an n-dimensional measurement to a 1D vector by flattening
according to a specified dimension order. Stores metadata needed to
reconstruct the original nD structure via \code{\link[=measure_fold]{measure_fold()}}.
}
\details{
Unfolding is useful for:
\itemize{
\item Applying 1D modeling techniques (PCA, PLS) to nD data
\item Exporting to formats that expect 1D vectors
\item Visualization as a single trace
}

The fold metadata includes:
\itemize{
\item \code{ndim}: Original number of dimensions
\item \code{dim_names}, \code{dim_units}: Original dimension metadata
\item \code{coordinates}: The original coordinate values for each dimension
\item \code{order}: The unfolding order used
}
}
\examples{
# Create a 2D measurement (3 x 4 grid)
m2d <- new_measure_nd_tbl(
  location_1 = rep(1:3, each = 4),
  location_2 = rep(1:4, times = 3),
  value = 1:12,
  dim_names = c("time", "wavelength")
)

# Unfold to 1D
m1d <- measure_unfold(m2d)
m1d

# Reconstruct
m2d_restored <- measure_fold(m1d)
