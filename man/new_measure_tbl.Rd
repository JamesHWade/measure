\title{Create a new measure tibble}
\usage{
new_measure_tbl(location = double(), value = double())
}
\arguments{
\item{location}{Numeric vector of measurement locations (e.g., wavelengths,
wavenumbers, retention times).}

\item{value}{Numeric vector of measurement values (e.g., absorbance,
intensity, signal).}
}
\value{
A tibble with class \code{measure_tbl} containing \code{location} and \code{value}
columns.
}
\description{
Constructor for creating a single measurement object containing
location (e.g., wavelength, retention time) and value pairs.
}
\examples{
# Create a simple spectrum
spec <- new_measure_tbl(
  location = seq(1000, 1100, by = 10),
  value = sin(seq(1000, 1100, by = 10) / 50)
)
