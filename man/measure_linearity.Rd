\title{Linearity Assessment}
\usage{
measure_linearity(
  data,
  conc_col,
  response_col,
  method = c("regression", "residual"),
  conf_level = 0.95
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing concentration and response data.}

\item{conc_col}{Name of the column containing concentrations.}

\item{response_col}{Name of the column containing responses.}

\item{method}{Linearity assessment method:
\itemize{
\item \code{"regression"} (default): Linear regression with diagnostics
\item \code{"residual"}: Residual analysis and lack-of-fit test
}}

\item{conf_level}{Confidence level for intervals. Default is 0.95.}
}
\value{
A \code{measure_linearity} object containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{r_squared}: Coefficient of determination
\item \code{adj_r_squared}: Adjusted R-squared
\item \code{slope}: Regression slope with CI
\item \code{intercept}: Regression intercept with CI
\item \code{residual_sd}: Residual standard deviation
\item \code{lack_of_fit}: Lack-of-fit test results (if replicates exist)
\item \code{range}: Concentration range evaluated
}
}
\description{
Assesses linearity of a method by evaluating the relationship between
response and concentration across the specified range.
}
\details{
Linearity demonstrates that the method produces results that are
directly proportional to analyte concentration within a given range.
\subsection{Assessment Criteria}{
\itemize{
\item R-squared >= 0.99 (typical for many applications)
\item Residuals randomly distributed around zero
\item No systematic pattern in residual plots
\item Lack-of-fit test not significant (p > 0.05)
}
}

\subsection{ICH Q2 Requirements}{

Linearity should be evaluated across the range with at least 5
concentration levels. Report the regression equation, correlation
coefficient, and visual inspection of residual plots.
