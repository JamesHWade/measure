\usage{
measure_carryover(
  data,
  response_col,
  sample_type_col,
  run_order_col,
  blank_type = "blank",
  high_type = "high",
  threshold = 20,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the run sequence with blanks after highs.}

\item{response_col}{Name of the column containing response values.}

\item{sample_type_col}{Name of the column identifying sample types.}

\item{run_order_col}{Name of the column containing run order.}

\item{blank_type}{Value identifying blank samples. Default is \code{"blank"}.}

\item{high_type}{Value identifying high-concentration samples. Default is \code{"high"}.}

\item{threshold}{Carryover threshold as percentage of LLOQ or high response.
Default is 20 (meaning 20\% of LLOQ).}

\item{lloq}{Optional LLOQ value for threshold calculation.}
}
\value{
A \code{measure_carryover} object containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{blank_responses}: Response values in blanks after high samples
\item \code{mean_blank}: Mean blank response
\item \code{max_blank}: Maximum blank response
\item \code{high_responses}: High sample responses
\item \code{carryover_pct}: Carryover as percentage of high or LLOQ
\item \code{pass}: Whether carryover is within acceptable limits
}
}
\description{
Evaluates carryover by analyzing blank samples run after high-concentration
samples.
}
\details{
Carryover is the appearance of analyte in a blank sample due to
contamination from a previous high-concentration sample. It is typically
assessed by analyzing blank samples immediately after the highest
calibration standard or QC sample.
\subsection{Acceptance Criteria (ICH M10)}{

Carryover in the blank sample following the high concentration should
not exceed:
\itemize{
\item 20\% of the LLOQ (for the analyte)
\item 5\% of the internal standard response
}
}
}
\examples{
# Carryover assessment
data <- data.frame(
  run_order = 1:10,
  sample_type = c("std", "std", "std", "high", "blank",
                  "qc", "qc", "high", "blank", "std"),
  response = c(100, 500, 1000, 5000, 5, 500, 510, 4900, 8, 100)
)

result <- measure_carryover(
  data,
  response_col = "response",
  sample_type_col = "sample_type",
  run_order_col = "run_order",
  lloq = 50
)
print(result)
