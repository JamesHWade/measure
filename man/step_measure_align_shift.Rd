\title{Shift Alignment via Cross-Correlation}
\usage{
step_measure_align_shift(
  recipe,
  measures = NULL,
  max_shift = 10L,
  reference = c("mean", "median", "first"),
  role = NA,
  trained = FALSE,
  skip = FALSE,
  id = recipes::rand_id("measure_align_shift")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object.}

\item{measures}{An optional character vector of measure column names.}

\item{max_shift}{Maximum shift (in points) to consider. Default is 10.
Tunable via \code{\link[=align_max_shift]{align_max_shift()}}.}

\item{reference}{How to determine the reference:
\itemize{
\item \code{"mean"} (default): Use the mean spectrum from training
\item \code{"median"}: Use the median spectrum from training
\item \code{"first"}: Use the first sample
}}

\item{role}{Not used.}

\item{trained}{Logical indicating if the step has been trained.}

\item{skip}{Logical. Should the step be skipped when baking?}

\item{id}{Unique step identifier.}
}
\value{
An updated recipe with the new step added.
}
\description{
\code{step_measure_align_shift()} creates a \emph{specification} of a recipe step that
aligns spectra by finding the optimal shift using cross-correlation.
}
\details{
This step corrects for small linear shifts between spectra, which can occur
due to:
\itemize{
\item Wavelength calibration drift
\item Sample positioning differences
\item Temperature effects on instrument
}

The optimal shift is found by maximizing the cross-correlation between
each spectrum and the reference. After shifting, edge values are filled
by constant extrapolation.
