\title{Get axis information from measure data}
\usage{
measure_axis_info(x, sample = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{measure_tbl}, \code{measure_list}, or data frame with measure column.}

\item{sample}{Integer index of sample to analyze (for \code{measure_list}).
Default is 1.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\itemize{
\item \code{min}, \code{max}: Range of location values
\item \code{n_points}: Number of data points
\item \code{spacing}: Median absolute spacing between points
\item \code{direction}: "increasing", "decreasing", or "mixed"
\item \code{regular}: Logical indicating if spacing is regular (within tolerance)
\item \code{axis_type}: Inferred axis type (see \code{\link[=infer_axis_type]{infer_axis_type()}})
}
}
\description{
Extracts metadata about the axis (location dimension) of measure data,
including range, spacing, direction, and inferred axis type.

\examples{
# NIR spectrum
spec <- new_measure_tbl(
  location = seq(1000, 2500, by = 2),
  value = rnorm(751)
)
measure_axis_info(spec)

# Chromatogram
chrom <- new_measure_tbl(
  location = seq(0, 30, by = 0.01),
  value = rnorm(3001)
)
measure_axis_info(chrom)
