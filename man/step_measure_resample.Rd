\title{Resample Measurements to New Grid}
\usage{
step_measure_resample(
  recipe,
  n = NULL,
  spacing = NULL,
  range = NULL,
  method = c("linear", "spline"),
  measures = NULL,
  role = NA,
  trained = FALSE,
  new_locations = NULL,
  skip = FALSE,
  id = recipes::rand_id("measure_resample")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of
operations for this recipe.}

\item{n}{A positive integer specifying the number of points in the new grid.
Mutually exclusive with \code{spacing}.}

\item{spacing}{A positive numeric value specifying the spacing between points
in the new grid. Mutually exclusive with \code{n}.}

\item{range}{Optional numeric vector of length 2 specifying the range for the
new grid as \code{c(min, max)}. If \code{NULL} (default), uses the range of the
existing measurements.}

\item{method}{The interpolation method. One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"linear"}: Linear interpolation (default)
\item \code{"spline"}: Cubic spline interpolation (smoother)
}}

\item{measures}{An optional character vector of measure column names to
process. If \code{NULL} (the default), all measure columns will be processed.}

\item{role}{Not used by this step since no new variables are created.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the step has been trained.}

\item{new_locations}{The computed new grid locations (after training).}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when baking?}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step.}
}
\value{
An updated version of \code{recipe} with the new step added.
}
\description{
\code{step_measure_resample()} creates a \emph{specification} of a recipe step that
interpolates measurements to a new regular x-axis grid.
}
\details{
This step interpolates measurements to a new regular grid of x-axis values.
This is useful for:
\itemize{
\item Aligning data from different instruments with different sampling rates
\item Reducing data density for faster processing
\item Ensuring uniform spacing for methods that require it
\item Matching measurements to a reference grid
}

The new grid is determined during \code{prep()} based on the training data. If
\code{range} is not specified, the grid spans from the minimum to maximum
location values in the training data.

\strong{Interpolation methods:}
\itemize{
\item \code{"linear"}: Fast and simple, may introduce slight distortion at peaks
\item \code{"spline"}: Smoother interpolation that preserves peak shape better
}
