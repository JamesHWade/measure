\title{Trim Measurements to Specified Range}
\usage{
step_measure_trim(
  recipe,
  range,
  measures = NULL,
  role = NA,
  trained = FALSE,
  skip = FALSE,
  id = recipes::rand_id("measure_trim")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of
operations for this recipe.}

\item{range}{A numeric vector of length 2 specifying the range to keep as
\code{c(min, max)}. Points with location >= min and <= max are retained.}

\item{measures}{An optional character vector of measure column names to
process. If \code{NULL} (the default), all measure columns will be processed.}

\item{role}{Not used by this step since no new variables are created.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the step has been trained.}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when baking?}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step.}
}
\value{
An updated version of \code{recipe} with the new step added.
}
\description{
\code{step_measure_trim()} creates a \emph{specification} of a recipe step that
keeps only the measurement points within the specified x-axis range(s).
}
\details{
This step filters measurements to keep only points within the specified
range. This is useful for:
\itemize{
\item Defining integration windows (e.g., keep only 8-18 mL elution range)
\item Removing noisy regions at start/end of measurement
\item Focusing analysis on a region of interest
}

Points with location values outside the range are removed. The order of
remaining points is preserved.

\examples{
library(recipes)

# Keep only a specific wavelength range
rec <- recipe(water + fat + protein ~ ., data = meats_long) |>
  update_role(id, new_role = "id") |>
  step_measure_input_long(transmittance, location = vars(channel)) |>
  step_measure_trim(range = c(10, 90)) |>
  prep()

bake(rec, new_data = NULL)
