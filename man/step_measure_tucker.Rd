\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object.}

\item{...}{One or more selector functions to choose measure columns.
If empty, all nD measure columns are used.}

\item{ranks}{A vector of ranks for each mode. If a single integer,
the same rank is used for all modes. Default is 3.}

\item{center}{Logical. Should data be centered before decomposition?
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{scale}{Logical. Should data be scaled before decomposition?
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{max_iter}{Maximum number of iterations. Default is 500.}

\item{tol}{Convergence tolerance. Default is 1e-6.}

\item{prefix}{Prefix for output column names. Default is \code{"tucker_"}.}

\item{role}{Not used.}

\item{trained}{Logical indicating if the step has been trained.}

\item{skip}{Logical. Should the step be skipped when baking?}

\item{id}{Unique step identifier.}
}
\value{
An updated recipe with the new step added.
}
\description{
\code{step_measure_tucker()} creates a \emph{specification} of a recipe step that
applies Tucker decomposition to multi-dimensional measurement data,
extracting component scores as features for modeling.
}
\details{
Tucker decomposition (also known as higher-order SVD or multilinear SVD)
decomposes a tensor into a core tensor multiplied by factor matrices along
each mode. Unlike PARAFAC, Tucker allows different ranks for each mode,
providing more flexibility.
\subsection{Requirements}{
\itemize{
\item Input must be \code{measure_nd_list} with 2+ dimensions
\item All samples must have the same grid (regular, aligned)
\item The \code{multiway} package must be installed (in Suggests)
}
}

\subsection{Output}{

Creates numeric feature columns representing the unfolded core tensor
scores for each sample.
}
}
\note{
This step requires the \code{multiway} package. Install with:
\code{install.packages("multiway")}
