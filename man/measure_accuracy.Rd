\title{Accuracy Assessment}
\usage{
measure_accuracy(
  data,
  measured_col,
  reference_col,
  group_col = NULL,
  conf_level = 0.95
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing measured and reference values.}

\item{measured_col}{Name of the column containing measured values.}

\item{reference_col}{Name of the column containing reference/nominal values.}

\item{group_col}{Optional grouping column (e.g., concentration level).}

\item{conf_level}{Confidence level for intervals. Default is 0.95.}
}
\value{
A \code{measure_accuracy} object containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{n}: Number of observations
\item \code{mean_measured}: Mean of measured values
\item \code{mean_reference}: Mean of reference values
\item \code{bias}: Absolute bias (measured - reference)
\item \code{bias_pct}: Relative bias as percentage
\item \code{recovery}: Recovery percentage (measured/reference * 100)
\item \code{recovery_ci_lower}, \code{recovery_ci_upper}: Confidence interval for recovery
}
}
\description{
Calculates accuracy metrics including bias, recovery, and confidence intervals
for method validation.
}
\details{
Accuracy expresses the closeness of agreement between a measured value
and a reference value. It is typically assessed using:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Bias}: Systematic difference from the reference value
\item \strong{Recovery}: Percentage of the reference value that is measured
}
\subsection{ICH Q2 Requirements}{

Accuracy should be assessed at a minimum of 3 concentration levels
covering the specified range (typically 80-120\% of the target).

\examples{
# Accuracy at multiple levels
set.seed(123)
data <- data.frame(
  level = rep(c("low", "mid", "high"), each = 5),
  nominal = rep(c(10, 50, 100), each = 5),
  measured = c(
    rnorm(5, 10.2, 0.3),
    rnorm(5, 49.5, 1.5),
    rnorm(5, 101, 3)
  )
)

result <- measure_accuracy(data, "measured", "nominal", group_col = "level")
print(result)
