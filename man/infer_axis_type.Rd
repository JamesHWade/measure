\title{Infer axis type from location values}
\usage{
infer_axis_type(location)
}
\arguments{
\item{location}{Numeric vector of location values.}
}
\value{
Character string indicating inferred axis type:
\itemize{
\item \code{"wavelength_nm"}: Visible/NIR wavelengths (typically 300-2500 nm)
\item \code{"wavenumber"}: Mid-IR wavenumbers (typically 400-4000 cm^-1)
\item \code{"retention_time"}: Chromatography retention time (typically 0-60 min)
\item \code{"mass_charge"}: Mass spectrometry m/z (typically 50-2000+)
\item \code{"ppm"}: NMR chemical shift (typically -2 to 14 ppm)
\item \code{"two_theta"}: XRD diffraction angle (typically 5-90 degrees)
\item \code{"temperature"}: Thermal analysis (typically 20-1000 C)
\item \code{"unknown"}: Could not determine axis type
}
}
\description{
Attempts to infer the type of measurement axis based on the range and
characteristics of location values. This is a heuristic that helps
guide appropriate preprocessing choices.

\examples{
# NIR wavelengths
infer_axis_type(seq(1000, 2500, by = 2))

# Mid-IR wavenumbers
infer_axis_type(seq(4000, 400, by = -4))

# Retention time (minutes)
infer_axis_type(seq(0, 30, by = 0.01))

# NMR chemical shift
infer_axis_type(seq(0, 12, by = 0.001))
