\title{Create a new n-dimensional measure tibble}
\usage{
new_measure_nd_tbl(..., value = double(), dim_names = NULL, dim_units = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Named location vectors. Names should follow the pattern
\code{location_1}, \code{location_2}, etc. Each must be a numeric vector
of the same length.}

\item{value}{Numeric vector of measurement values (e.g., absorbance,
intensity, signal). Must have the same length as location vectors.}

\item{dim_names}{Optional character vector of semantic dimension names
(e.g., \code{c("wavelength", "retention_time")}).}

\item{dim_units}{Optional character vector of dimension units
(e.g., \code{c("nm", "min")}).}
}
\value{
A tibble with class \code{measure_nd_tbl} containing \code{location_1},
\code{location_2}, ..., \code{location_n}, and \code{value} columns. Attributes
include \code{ndim}, \code{dim_names}, \code{dim_units}, and \code{dim_order}.
}
\description{
Constructor for creating a single n-dimensional measurement object
containing location coordinates (e.g., wavelength, retention time)
and values.
}
\examples{
# Create a 2D measurement (e.g., LC-UV: retention time x wavelength)
meas_2d <- new_measure_nd_tbl(
  location_1 = rep(seq(0, 10, length.out = 5), each = 3),
  location_2 = rep(c(254, 280, 320), times = 5),
  value = rnorm(15),
  dim_names = c("retention_time", "wavelength"),
  dim_units = c("min", "nm")
)
meas_2d
