\usage{
step_measure_normalize_range(
  recipe,
  measures = NULL,
  role = NA,
  trained = FALSE,
  skip = FALSE,
  id = recipes::rand_id("measure_normalize_range")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of
operations for this recipe.}

\item{measures}{An optional character vector of measure column names to
process. If \code{NULL} (the default), all measure columns (columns with class
\code{measure_list}) will be processed. Use this to limit processing to specific
measure columns when working with multiple measurement types.}

\item{role}{Not used by this step since no new variables are created.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the quantities for preprocessing
have been estimated.}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when the recipe is baked
by \code{\link[recipes:bake]{recipes::bake()}}? While all operations are baked when \code{\link[recipes:prep]{recipes::prep()}} is run, some
operations may not be able to be conducted on new data (e.g. processing
the outcome variable(s)). Care should be taken when using \code{skip = TRUE}
as it may affect the computations for subsequent operations.}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}
}
\value{
An updated version of \code{recipe} with the new step added to the
sequence of any existing operations.
}
\description{
\code{step_measure_normalize_range()} creates a \emph{specification} of a recipe step that
applies min-max normalization to scale each spectrum to the range 0 to 1.
}
\details{
For each spectrum \eqn{x}, the transformation is:

\deqn{x_{norm} = \frac{x - \min(x)}{\max(x) - \min(x)}}{x_norm = (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))}

After transformation, the minimum value of each spectrum will be 0 and the
maximum will be 1.

If the range is zero (constant spectrum), a warning is issued and centered
values are returned (minimum subtracted but no scaling).

\strong{No selectors should be supplied to this step function}. The data should be
in the internal format produced by \code{\link[=step_measure_input_wide]{step_measure_input_wide()}} or
\code{\link[=step_measure_input_long]{step_measure_input_long()}}.
