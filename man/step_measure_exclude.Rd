\usage{
step_measure_exclude(
  recipe,
  ranges,
  measures = NULL,
  role = NA,
  trained = FALSE,
  skip = FALSE,
  id = recipes::rand_id("measure_exclude")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of
operations for this recipe.}

\item{ranges}{A list of numeric vectors, each of length 2 specifying ranges
to exclude as \code{c(min, max)}. Points with location >= min and <= max in
any range are removed.}

\item{measures}{An optional character vector of measure column names to
process. If \code{NULL} (the default), all measure columns will be processed.}

\item{role}{Not used by this step since no new variables are created.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the step has been trained.}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when baking?}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step.}
}
\value{
An updated version of \code{recipe} with the new step added.
}
\description{
\code{step_measure_exclude()} creates a \emph{specification} of a recipe step that
removes measurement points within the specified x-axis range(s).
}
\details{
This step removes measurements falling within specified ranges. This is
useful for:
\itemize{
\item Removing solvent peaks in chromatography
\item Excluding system peaks or artifacts
\item Removing detector saturation regions
\item Removing known interference regions in spectroscopy
}

Multiple ranges can be excluded by providing a list of ranges. Points
falling within any of the specified ranges are removed.
}
\examples{
library(recipes)

# Exclude specific regions (e.g., solvent peaks)
rec <- recipe(water + fat + protein ~ ., data = meats_long) |>
  update_role(id, new_role = "id") |>
  step_measure_input_long(transmittance, location = vars(channel)) |>
  step_measure_exclude(ranges = list(c(1, 5), c(95, 100))) |>
  prep()

bake(rec, new_data = NULL)
