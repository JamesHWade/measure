\usage{
step_measure_normalize_auc(
  recipe,
  measures = NULL,
  role = NA,
  trained = FALSE,
  skip = FALSE,
  id = recipes::rand_id("measure_normalize_auc")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of
operations for this recipe.}

\item{measures}{An optional character vector of measure column names to
process. If \code{NULL} (the default), all measure columns (columns with class
\code{measure_list}) will be processed. Use this to limit processing to specific
measure columns when working with multiple measurement types.}

\item{role}{Not used by this step since no new variables are created.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the quantities for preprocessing
have been estimated.}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when the recipe is baked
by \code{\link[recipes:bake]{recipes::bake()}}? While all operations are baked when \code{\link[recipes:prep]{recipes::prep()}} is run, some
operations may not be able to be conducted on new data (e.g. processing
the outcome variable(s)). Care should be taken when using \code{skip = TRUE}
as it may affect the computations for subsequent operations.}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}
}
\value{
An updated version of \code{recipe} with the new step added to the
sequence of any existing operations.
}
\description{
\code{step_measure_normalize_auc()} creates a \emph{specification} of a recipe step that
divides each spectrum by its area under the curve (computed using trapezoidal
integration). This is useful for chromatography where peak areas are meaningful.
}
\details{
The area under the curve is computed using trapezoidal integration:

\deqn{AUC = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{(y_i + y_{i+1})}{2} \cdot (x_{i+1} - x_i)}{AUC = sum((y[i] + y[i+1]) / 2 * (x[i+1] - x[i]))}

where \eqn{y} are the values and \eqn{x} are the locations.

After transformation, the AUC of each spectrum will equal 1.

If the AUC is zero or NA, a warning is issued and the original values are
returned unchanged. At least 2 points are required for integration.

\strong{No selectors should be supplied to this step function}. The data should be
in the internal format produced by \code{\link[=step_measure_input_wide]{step_measure_input_wide()}} or
\code{\link[=step_measure_input_long]{step_measure_input_long()}}.
