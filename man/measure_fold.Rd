\title{Fold 1D measurement back to n-dimensional}
\usage{
measure_fold(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{measure_tbl} or \code{measure_list} with \code{"fold_info"} attribute.}
}
\value{
A \code{measure_nd_tbl} or \code{measure_nd_list} with the original
dimensional structure restored.
}
\description{
Reconstructs an n-dimensional measurement from a 1D vector that was
created by \code{\link[=measure_unfold]{measure_unfold()}}. Requires the fold metadata attribute.
}
\examples{
# Create, unfold, then fold back
m2d <- new_measure_nd_tbl(
  location_1 = rep(1:3, each = 4),
  location_2 = rep(1:4, times = 3),
  value = 1:12
)

m1d <- measure_unfold(m2d)
m2d_restored <- measure_fold(m1d)

# Values are preserved
all.equal(m2d$value, m2d_restored$value)

}
