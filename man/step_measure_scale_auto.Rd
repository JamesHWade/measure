\usage{
step_measure_scale_auto(
  recipe,
  measures = NULL,
  role = NA,
  trained = FALSE,
  learned_params = NULL,
  skip = FALSE,
  id = recipes::rand_id("measure_scale_auto")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of
operations for this recipe.}

\item{measures}{An optional character vector of measure column names to
process. If \code{NULL} (the default), all measure columns (columns with class
\code{measure_list}) will be processed. Use this to limit processing to specific
measure columns when working with multiple measurement types.}

\item{role}{Not used by this step since no new variables are created.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the quantities for preprocessing
have been estimated.}

\item{learned_params}{A named list containing learned means and locations
for each measure column. This is \code{NULL} until the step is trained.}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when the recipe is baked
by \code{\link[recipes:bake]{recipes::bake()}}? While all operations are baked when \code{\link[recipes:prep]{recipes::prep()}} is run, some
operations may not be able to be conducted on new data (e.g. processing
the outcome variable(s)). Care should be taken when using \code{skip = TRUE}
as it may affect the computations for subsequent operations.}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}
}
\value{
An updated version of \code{recipe} with the new step added to the
sequence of any existing operations.
}
\description{
\code{step_measure_scale_auto()} creates a \emph{specification} of a recipe step that
applies auto-scaling (also known as z-score normalization or standardization)
at each measurement location. This centers and scales to unit variance.
}
\details{
Auto-scaling (standardization) transforms each variable to have zero mean
and unit variance. This gives equal importance to all measurement locations
regardless of their original scale.

For a data matrix \eqn{X}, the transformation is:

\deqn{X_{scaled} = \frac{X - \bar{X}}{s_X}}{X_scaled = (X - mean(X)) / sd(X)}

where \eqn{\bar{X}}{mean(X)} and \eqn{s_X}{sd(X)} are the column-wise mean
and standard deviation computed from the training data.

If a column has zero standard deviation (constant values), that column is
only centered, not scaled (the divisor is set to 1).

The means and standard deviations are learned during \code{prep()} from the
training data and stored for use when applying the transformation to new
data during \code{bake()}.

\strong{No selectors should be supplied to this step function}. The data should be
in the internal format produced by \code{\link[=step_measure_input_wide]{step_measure_input_wide()}} or
\code{\link[=step_measure_input_long]{step_measure_input_long()}}.
