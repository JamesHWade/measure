\usage{
step_measure_output_long(
  recipe,
  values_to = ".measure",
  location_to = ".location",
  measures = NULL,
  role = "predictor",
  trained = FALSE,
  skip = FALSE,
  id = rand_id("measure_output_long")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of
operations for this recipe.}

\item{values_to}{A single character string for the column containing the
analytical measurement.}

\item{location_to}{A single character string for the column name prefix for
location columns. For 1D data, this becomes the column name (default:
\code{.location}). For nD data, this becomes a prefix with dimension suffixes
(e.g., \code{.location_1}, \code{.location_2}).}

\item{measures}{An optional single character string specifying which measure
column to output. If \code{NULL} (the default) and only one measure column
exists, that column will be used. If multiple measure columns exist and
\code{measures} is \code{NULL}, an error will be thrown prompting you to specify
which column to output.}

\item{role}{Not used by this step since no new variables are created.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the quantities for preprocessing have
been estimated.}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when the recipe is baked by
\code{\link[recipes:bake]{bake()}}? While all operations are baked when \code{\link[recipes:prep]{prep()}} is run, some
operations may not be able to be conducted on new data (e.g. processing the
outcome variable(s)). Care should be taken when using \code{skip = TRUE} as it
may affect the computations for subsequent operations.}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}
}
\description{
\code{step_measure_output_long} creates a \emph{specification} of a recipe
}
\details{
step that converts measures to a format with columns for the measurement and
the corresponding location (i.e., "long" format).

This step is designed convert analytical measurements from their internal
data structure to a long format with explicit location columns.

For 1D data, the output has two columns: the measurement value and a single
location column.

For n-dimensional data (2D, 3D, etc.), the output has n+1 columns: the
measurement value and n location columns named with the \code{location_to} prefix
followed by dimension numbers (e.g., \code{.location_1}, \code{.location_2}).
