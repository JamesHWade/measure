# Convert Transmittance to Absorbance

`step_measure_absorbance()` creates a *specification* of a recipe step
that converts transmittance values to absorbance using the Beer-Lambert
law.

## Usage

``` r
step_measure_absorbance(
  recipe,
  measures = NULL,
  role = NA,
  trained = FALSE,
  skip = FALSE,
  id = recipes::rand_id("measure_absorbance")
)
```

## Arguments

- recipe:

  A recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of operations
  for this recipe.

- measures:

  An optional character vector of measure column names to process. If
  `NULL` (the default), all measure columns will be processed.

- role:

  Not used by this step since no new variables are created.

- trained:

  A logical to indicate if the step has been trained.

- skip:

  A logical. Should the step be skipped when baking?

- id:

  A character string that is unique to this step.

## Value

An updated version of `recipe` with the new step added.

## Details

This step applies the Beer-Lambert law transformation:

\$\$A = -\log\_{10}(T)\$\$

where \\T\\ is transmittance and \\A\\ is absorbance.

**Important**: Transmittance values should be in the range (0, 1\] or
(0, 100\]. Zero or negative values will produce `-Inf` or `NaN` with a
warning.

The measurement locations are preserved unchanged.
