# Robust Fitting Baseline Correction

`step_measure_baseline_rf()` creates a *specification* of a recipe step
that applies robust fitting baseline correction to measurement data.
This method uses local regression with iterative reweighting to fit a
baseline that is resistant to peaks.

## Usage

``` r
step_measure_baseline_rf(
  recipe,
  measures = NULL,
  span = 2/3,
  maxit = c(5L, 5L),
  role = NA,
  trained = FALSE,
  skip = FALSE,
  id = recipes::rand_id("measure_baseline_rf")
)
```

## Arguments

- recipe:

  A recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of operations
  for this recipe.

- measures:

  An optional character vector of measure column names to process. If
  `NULL` (the default), all measure columns (columns with class
  `measure_list`) will be processed.

- span:

  Controls the amount of smoothing. This is the fraction of data used in
  computing each fitted value. Default is `2/3`. Smaller values produce
  less smooth baselines that follow local features more closely.

- maxit:

  A length-2 integer vector specifying the number of iterations for the
  robust fit. The first value is for the asymmetric weighting function,
  the second for symmetric weighting. Default is `c(5, 5)`.

- role:

  Not used by this step since no new variables are created.

- trained:

  A logical to indicate if the quantities for preprocessing have been
  estimated.

- skip:

  A logical. Should the step be skipped when the recipe is baked?

- id:

  A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.

## Value

An updated version of `recipe` with the new step added to the sequence
of any existing operations.

## Details

Robust fitting baseline correction uses local polynomial regression
(LOESS/LOWESS) with iterative reweighting to estimate the baseline. The
algorithm uses asymmetric weights in initial iterations to down-weight
peaks, then symmetric weights for final smoothing.

This method is particularly effective for:

- Spectra with peaks of varying widths

- Data where the baseline shape is not well-described by a polynomial

- Situations where peaks should not influence the baseline estimate

The `span` parameter controls the trade-off between smoothness and local
adaptation:

- Larger span (e.g., 0.8): Smoother baseline, may miss local variations

- Smaller span (e.g., 0.3): More local adaptation, may overfit

**No selectors should be supplied to this step function**. The data
should be in the internal format produced by
[`step_measure_input_wide()`](https://jameshwade.github.io/measure/dev/reference/step_measure_input_wide.md)
or
[`step_measure_input_long()`](https://jameshwade.github.io/measure/dev/reference/step_measure_input_long.md).

## Tidying

When you
[`tidy()`](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/reference/tidy.recipe.html)
this step, a tibble with columns `terms`, `span`, and `id` is returned.
