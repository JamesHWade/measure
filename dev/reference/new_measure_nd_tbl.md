# Create a new n-dimensional measure tibble

Constructor for creating a single n-dimensional measurement object
containing location coordinates (e.g., wavelength, retention time) and
values.

## Usage

``` r
new_measure_nd_tbl(..., value = double(), dim_names = NULL, dim_units = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- ...:

  Named location vectors. Names should follow the pattern `location_1`,
  `location_2`, etc. Each must be a numeric vector of the same length.

- value:

  Numeric vector of measurement values (e.g., absorbance, intensity,
  signal). Must have the same length as location vectors.

- dim_names:

  Optional character vector of semantic dimension names (e.g.,
  `c("wavelength", "retention_time")`).

- dim_units:

  Optional character vector of dimension units (e.g., `c("nm", "min")`).

## Value

A tibble with class `measure_nd_tbl` containing `location_1`,
`location_2`, ..., `location_n`, and `value` columns. Attributes include
`ndim`, `dim_names`, `dim_units`, and `dim_order`.

## Examples

``` r
# Create a 2D measurement (e.g., LC-UV: retention time x wavelength)
meas_2d <- new_measure_nd_tbl(
  location_1 = rep(seq(0, 10, length.out = 5), each = 3),
  location_2 = rep(c(254, 280, 320), times = 5),
  value = rnorm(15),
  dim_names = c("retention_time", "wavelength"),
  dim_units = c("min", "nm")
)
meas_2d

#> <measure_tbl [15 x 3]>
