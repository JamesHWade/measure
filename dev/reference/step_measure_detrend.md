# Remove Trend from Measurements

`step_measure_detrend()` creates a *specification* of a recipe step that
removes a polynomial trend from measurement data. This is useful for
removing drift, offset, or slowly varying background effects.

## Usage

``` r
step_measure_detrend(
  recipe,
  measures = NULL,
  degree = 1L,
  role = NA,
  trained = FALSE,
  skip = FALSE,
  id = recipes::rand_id("measure_detrend")
)
```

## Arguments

- recipe:

  A recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of operations
  for this recipe.

- measures:

  An optional character vector of measure column names to process. If
  `NULL` (the default), all measure columns (columns with class
  `measure_list`) will be processed.

- degree:

  Polynomial degree for trend fitting. Default is `1` (linear
  detrending). Use `0` to remove only the mean (centering).

- role:

  Not used by this step since no new variables are created.

- trained:

  A logical to indicate if the quantities for preprocessing have been
  estimated.

- skip:

  A logical. Should the step be skipped when the recipe is baked?

- id:

  A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.

## Value

An updated version of `recipe` with the new step added to the sequence
of any existing operations.

## Details

Detrending removes a polynomial trend from each spectrum. This is
simpler than baseline correction methods like ALS or robust fitting, but
effective for:

- **Linear drift** (`degree = 1`): Instrumental drift, temperature
  effects

- **Offset removal** (`degree = 0`): Centers each spectrum at zero mean

- **Curved trends** (`degree = 2+`): Gradual curvature from scattering

Unlike
[`step_measure_baseline_poly()`](https://jameshwade.github.io/measure/dev/reference/step_measure_baseline_poly.md),
detrending fits the polynomial to ALL points without iterative peak
exclusion. This makes it faster and appropriate when:

- The trend is the dominant feature (not peaks)

- You want to preserve peak structure while removing background

- Processing time-series or process data with drift

**No selectors should be supplied to this step function**. The data
should be in the internal format produced by
[`step_measure_input_wide()`](https://jameshwade.github.io/measure/dev/reference/step_measure_input_wide.md)
or
[`step_measure_input_long()`](https://jameshwade.github.io/measure/dev/reference/step_measure_input_long.md).

## Tidying

When you
[`tidy()`](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/reference/tidy.recipe.html)
this step, a tibble with columns `terms`, `degree`, and `id` is
returned.
